The scripts in this folder were used to perform local ancestry analysis using RFMix. Genomes were first phased using Eagle v2.0 with the HRC panel via the Sanger Imputation Service (https://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/tools/sanger-imputation-service).

Many of these scripts were adapted from Dr. Alicia Martin's earlier pipeline: https://github.com/armartin/ancestry_pipeline
